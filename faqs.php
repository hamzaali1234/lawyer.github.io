            <div class="panel-body">Ans: If wife is not delegated the right of divorce in her nikanama (marriage contract form) then she would apply for khula in the court.

In case where the husband or his representative appear he is required to file a written statement following which the court has to fix a date for pre-trial proceedings for reconciliation. If reconciliation fails court will pass decree for dissolution of marriage.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">Ans: Yes, wife can divorce; if so delegated in the nikanama (marriage contract form) the said right is called Talak-e-Tafweez (delegated powers of divorce). Husband may delegate right to divorce while contracting marriage as per paragraph 18 of the Nikahnama, then the wife has a right to divorce, otherwise it is the exclusive right of the husband. But if wife has no such right and she wants dissolution of marriage then she can file a suit for the “Dissolution of Marriage” on the basis of Khula or seeks divorce both through intervention of the court.</div>
